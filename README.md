# Python Folium: Create Web Maps From Your Data

This repository contains an example HTML page that is [available online as an interactive map](https://realpython.github.io/ecological-footprint/) created following the tutorial [Python Folium: Create Web Maps From Your Data](https://realpython.com/python-folium-web-maps-from-data/) on Real Python.

It serves as an example how you can host the HTML page that `folium` generates on a static file hosting service such as [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).
